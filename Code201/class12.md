Chart.js provides a set of frequently used chart types, plugins, and customization options. In addition to a reasonable set of built-in chart types, you can use additional community-maintained chart types. On top of that, it’s possible to combine several chart types into a mixed chart (essentially, blending multiple chart types into one on the same canvas). Chart.js is highly customizable with custom plugins to create annotations, zoom, or drag-and-drop functionalities to name a few things. The canvas rendering that Chart.js uses reduces the toll on your DOM tree in comparison to SVG rendering. Also, tree-shaking support allows you to include minimal parts of Chart.js code into your bundle, reducing bundle size and page load time.
