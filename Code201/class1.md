# Class 1

Beginning to get a grasp on how the web works, website design, html, css, javascript, etc. is integral to the first steps in learning how to code.

## Reading

### [Getting Started](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web)

* Skim [How the Web Works.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works)
* Skim [Website Design and Process.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/What_will_your_website_look_like)
* Read the following sections of [JavaScript Basics:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) Start at “What is JavaScript?”, read through “Comments” section.

1.**Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.**

My attempt at a haiku! :nerd_face:

Client makes request

Server delivers response

HTTP helps

2.**Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.**

The browser parses the HTML first and recognizes any references to CSS or JavaScript, then sends seperate requests for those references, building a visual representation of the page with the received data.

3.**How can you find images to add to a Website?**

You can search and save via Google images, however, to reduce the risk of copyright violation you should choose the Creative Commons License option in usage rights under tools. There are also sites with royalty free images available.

4.**How do you create a `String` vs a `Number` in JavaScript?**

Strings are enclosed within single or double quotes. Numbers are simply numbers without quotes.

5.**What is a `Variable` and why are they important in JavaScript?**

A variable is a container that stores a value. Variables are needed to program dynamic and interesting things, like personalized messages or changing images.

### [Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML)

* Read the beginning of [Getting Started with HTML.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started) Start from the beginning and read through section “Anatomy of an HTML document”.
* [HTML Document Structure.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure)
* [Metadata in HTML.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML)

1.**What is an HTML attribute?**

Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't be displayed, but make it easier to target.

2.**Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element.**

The anatomy of an element contains and opening tag, a closing tag, and the content in between.

3.**What is the Difference between `<article>` and `<section>` element tags?**

An `<article>` encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page and a `<section>` , while similar, is for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality (like a set of article headlines and summaries), or a theme.

4.**What Elements does a “typical” website include?**

A "typical" website contains a body with a header, nav bar, main content, sidebar, and footer.

5.**How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?**

Specifying a description that includes keywords relating to the content of your page is useful as it has the potential to make your page appear higher in relevant searches performed in search engines.

6.**How is the `<meta>` HTML tag used when specifying metadata?**
