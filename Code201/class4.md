# Class 4

HTML, CSS, and JS understanding is essential to learning to code. Wash, rinse, repeat, add a little more and dig deeper.

### [Learn HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML)

[Creating Hyperlinks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks)

1.**To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?**

The \<a> element.

2.**The `href` attribute contains what information?**

The `href` aka hypertext reference or target contains the web address.

3.**What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?**

We can use the `title` attribute that contains additional information about the link when you hover over it, such as what kind of information the page contains, or things to be aware of on the website.

### [CSS Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout)

[CSS Layout: Normal Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow)

[CSS Layout: Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning)

1.**What is meant by “normal flow”?**
Normal flow is the default or the way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout.

2.**What are a few differences between `block-level` and `inline` elements?**

`Block-level` elements contents will fill the available inline space of the parent element containing it. The element grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content. `Inline` elements' size is just the size of their content.

3.**___ positioning is the default for every html element.**

Static

4.**Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.**

Absolute positioning allows us to create features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page, like pop up menus and features that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page.

5.**What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?**

Absolute positioning sits on it's own layer apart from everything else. Fixed positioning means the element is in its normal position in the document flow.

### [Learn JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)

[Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions)

1.**Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.**

A function declaration is naming and creating the function. An invocation is calling the function into action, making it work.

2.**What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?**

Parameters are values that need to be included inside the function parentheses, which it needs to do its job properly. Parameters are sometimes called arguments, properties, or even attributes. Arguments are the real values passed to the function and parameters are applied to the argument.

### Miscellaneous

[6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1.**Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.**

Pair programming touches on the four major components of learning, listening-speaking-reading-writing. While only taking slightly longer pair programming is proven to produce higher quality code. Two heads are better than one. It can also be easier to research as well as stay on track. All of this is super valuable in helping me become a better dev.

## Things I Want to Know More About

I want to begin to understand why things behave as they do with various CSS changes, rather than just trying things and vaguely grasping the concept if at all.
