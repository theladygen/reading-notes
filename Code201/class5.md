# Class 5

Digging deeper into structure and styling. I am excited to begin to move beyond basics in this realm and create more complexity in a site.

### [HTML Media](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding)

[Using Images In HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Images_in_HTML).

Read [Common Image Types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types) and [Choosing Image Formats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#choosing_an_image_format).

1.**What is a real world use case for the `alt` attribute being used in a website?**

If the user is visually impaired and using a screen reader having alt text available to describe images is very useful.

2.**How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?**

You can add titles and captions to your images.

3.**Provide an example of when the `figure` element would be useful in an HTML document.**

The figure element can be useful in an HTML document with an image, many images, a table or grid, map, video, anything that refers to the content on the page. It is an independent unit of content that expresses your meaning in a compact, easy-to-grasp way, can go in several places in the page's linear flow, and provides essential information supporting the main text.

4.**Describe the difference between a `gif` image and an `svg` image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.**

GIF is a good choice for simple images and animations. SVG files are ideal for diagrams, icons, and other images which can be accurately drawn at any size.

5.**What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?**

PNG is probably your best bet, but lossless WebP is arguably going to be better compressed.
You can also choose JPEG if compression artifacts aren't a concern.

[Styling HTML Text Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals)

1.**Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.**

Foreground defines the color of an HTML elements contents, like text, where background defines the elements background color.

2.**Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?**

There are many sites and color pickers online. I would look at something like Coolers and find a palette of 6 or so colors that was pleasing and fit the theme of the page and begin there.

3.**What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?**

When choosing a font consider it's browser availability.

4.**What do `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `font-style` do to HTML text elements?**

* `font-size` Sets the font size which is inherited from that element's parent element.
* `font-weight` Sets how bold the text is.
* `font-style` Used to turn italic text on or off.

5.**Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an `h1` element.**

You chould use letter-spacing or word-spacing properties to set the spacing between letters and words in an `h1`.

## Things I Want to Know More About

I would like to play around much more with many elements of CSS. Especially positioning elements in a variety of ways on a page.
