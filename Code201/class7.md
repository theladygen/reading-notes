### [Domain Modeling](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)

1.**Explain why we need domain modeling.**

Domain modeling can provide conceptual examples and a vocabulary for a specific problem that can be more easily understood when the technical and business teams communicate.

### [HTML Table Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics)

1.**Why should tables not be used for page layouts?**

Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users: the screen readers' output will be confusing to their users. Tables produce tag soup: table layouts generally involve more complex markup structures than proper layout techniques. This can result in the code being harder to write, maintain, and debug. Tables are not automatically responsive: tables are sized according to their content by default, so extra measures are needed to get table layout styling to effectively work across a variety of devices.

2.**List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML \<table>.**

\<td> table data
\<tr> table row
\<th> table head

### [Introducing Constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics#introducing_constructors)

1.**What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?**

Aconstructor defines the "shape" of an object and the set of methods and the properties it can have. An advantage of using constructors is that you can create as many objects as you like, and simply update the values for the properties that are different.

2.**How does the term `this` differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?**

Constructors bind `this` to the new object, so you can refer to this in your constructor code and when a change is made it won't affect all the parts of the object.

### [Object Prototypes Using A Constructor](https://ui.dev/beginners-guide-to-javascript-prototype)

1.**Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.**

Prototypes and inheritance in my work as as esthetician, hmmm... in terms of the services I offer - if we can say the service is an object and there are properties or things that happen within said service. Over time my services have evolved as I've gained experience and while my current services are different in ways they still retain all the things they did originally. My new services have inherited all the properties of my prototype original services as well as having properties of their own.

*NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question

Constructors, prototypes, inheritance, `this` ... I am only very loosely understanding at this moment.
