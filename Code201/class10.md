### [What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong)

1.**Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**

Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!
Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

2.**List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**

I've had lots of syntax errors, and the error notification in VSCode is super helpful. Also using inspect and narrowing down the line has been helpful. Logic errors are still much tougher.

3.**How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**

Debugging and finding how to fix problems is huge. Learning to use dev tools, improving my searches, etc will be integral to my skills.

### [The JavaScript Debugger.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger)

1.**How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**

The JavaScript debugger allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints, places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly. So to someone just starting I would say it's like using a bookmark to narrow down the search for where the issue might be.

2.**Define what a breakpoint is.**

A breakpoint is like a place marker you can place and pause, begin, or end at when debugging.

3.**What is the call stack?**

The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.
