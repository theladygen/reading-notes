1.**Why are forms so important in web development?**

Web forms are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a website or application. Forms allow users to enter data, which is generally sent to a web server for processing and storage (see Sending form data later in the module), or used on the client-side to immediately update the interface in some way (for example, add another item to a list, or show or hide a UI feature).

2.**When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?**

It's important to remember that the bigger your form, the more you risk frustrating people and losing users. Keep it simple and stay focused: ask only for the data you absolutely need.

3.**List 5 form elements and explain their importance.**

`<form>` This element formally defines a form and is a container element.

`<label>` represents a caption for an item in a user interface.

`<input>` is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent. The `<input>` element is one of the most powerful and complex in all of HTML due to the sheer number of combinations of input types and attributes.

`<textarea>`  represents a multi-line plain-text editing control, useful when you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form text, for example a comment on a review or feedback form.

`<button>` is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs an action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.

[Introduction To Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events).

1.**How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?**

Events are things that happen in the system you are programming. The system tells you about events so your code can react to them.

2.**When using the `addEventListener()` method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?**

You will need to provide and type and a listener.

3.**Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?**

 Sometimes, inside an event handler function, you'll see a parameter specified with a name such as event, evt, or e. This is called the event object, and it is automatically passed to event handlers to provide extra features and information.

4.**What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?**

Event bubbling describes how the browser handles events targeted at nested elements. This behavior can be useful and can also cause unexpected problems. Event capture is like event bubbling but the order is reversed: so instead of the event firing first on the innermost element targeted, and then on successively less nested elements, the event fires first on the least nested element, and then on successively more nested elements, until the target is reached.
