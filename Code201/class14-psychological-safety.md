### Discussion Questions

1.**What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?**

Equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking. Average social sensitivity. A sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up. Psychological safety describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.

2.**Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.**

I worked for years with different dance troupes. Some were driven by very dominant leaders, and some were much more of a collective atmosphere. I spent the longest and happiest amount of time in the groups that were appreciative of the contributions everyone in the group made, and empasiszed connection and bonding among the members as well. We cared about each other and were in tune with keeping a happy environment to work and create in, which made all the difference in the world. After experiencing groups before where we were afraid to speak up or look foolish, it was important to all of us to be a group that shares openly and keeps ideas flowing, as you never know what idea can spark another.

3.**What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?**

Having psycholigical safety allows members to feel like they can participate safely and contribute without worry of judgement. It makes the team overall more productive as it is inclusive of all minds and members, thereby positively affecting the company. Psychological safety contributes to a happier environment people want to work and grow within.
