***1.To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?***

I worked for years with different dance troupes. Some were driven by very dominant leaders, and some were much more of a collective atmosphere. I spent the longest and happiest amount of time in the groups that were appreciative of the contributions everyone in the group made, and emphasiszed connection and bonding among the members as well. We cared about each other and were in tune with keeping a happy environment to work and create in, which made all the difference in the world. After experiencing groups before where we were afraid to speak up or look foolish, it was important to all of us to be a group that shares openly and keeps ideas flowing, as you never know what idea can spark another.

***2.How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?***

Having psycholigical safety allows members to feel like they can participate safely and contribute without worry of judgement. It makes the team overall more productive as it is inclusive of all minds and members, thereby positively affecting the company. Psychological safety contributes to a happier environment people want to work and grow within, and this is something I will have my eye on.

[How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

***1.Who is Roy Fielding?***

He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

***2.Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?***

Because machines don't have a universal noun. Every programming language, database, or other kind of system has a different way of talking about nouns. That's why the URL is so important. It let's all of these systems tell each other about each other's nouns.

***3.What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?***

The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to. The protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns.

***4.What does a `GET` do?***

When you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

***5.What does a `POST` do?***

If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.

***6.What does `PUT` do?***

If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT.

***7.What does `PATCH` do?***

To do a partial update, it'll use PATCH.
