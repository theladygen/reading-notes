# My CF Reading Journal

*My name is Genevieve DuPuy and I currently work as a self employed esthetician/sugarist at my studio [Sugar Peeps](https://www.sugarpeeps.com) located in Ballard, WA. I am attending Code Fellows with aspirations to expand my skill set, grow my career, and thrive financially by taking a leap into the world of coding and tech.*

To me, a growth mindset means that we are always capable of growth and learning. There is never a time or place we reach where we know it all. Natural talent or abilities are lovely places to begin, but equal talents and skills can be developed through dedicated effort and perserverance. 

### 3 reminders to stay in a growth mindset:

* Being uncomfortable is good! Normal even! And only temporary! Discomfort inevitably will lead to growth. Let is be a sign of good things to come.
* Imposter syndrome will strike, but shifting focus to the inspiration that can be gleaned from mentors and peers can reignite the fire to persist.
* Challenges will present again and again. Remember your team, your resources, your ability to search the **MAGIC** that is the internet and find exactly what you need is always at your fingertips. Perserverence, baby!
