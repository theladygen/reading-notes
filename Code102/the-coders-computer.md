# The Coder's Computer: Class 2

1.**What are four important features to look for in a text editor?**

* *code completion*: allowing you to start typing and a display of suggestions for completing the code will be offered. This can save time, reduce typos, and is just overall nifty!  
* *syntax highlighting*: making it easier to see the beginning/opening and ending/closing of elements, etc. and highlighting certain errors.  
* *variety of extension offerings*: tools and accessories that assist you in your work, making things easier, more accurate, and add to overall functionality.  
* *variety of themes*: these change your background and text colors and can help reduce eye strain and fatigue, and just generally esthetically please your brain. Yay!

2.**What do the following commands do?**

* **pwd**  
  This stands for "print working directory" and will show you where you currently are within the terminal.
* **ls**  
  This stands for "list" and will display a listing of contents inside the current folder or file you are in.
* **cd**  
  This stands for "change directory" and will take you back home when ran by itself, or direct you to a specific directory when followed by a location name (argument).
* **mkdir**  
  This makes a new directory/folder.
* **touch**  
  This makes a new file.

3.**Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)**  

* **cd projects**  
  This will change directory taking you to the "projects" folder.
* **mkdir new-project**  
  This will create a new directory named "new-project".
* **touch new-project/newfile.md**  
  This will create a new markdown file within the new-project folder named "newfile.md".
* **cd ..**  
  This will change directory one level up along the hierarchy of the path you are currently at.
* **ls projects/new-project**  
  This will list the contents within the "new-project" directory.
