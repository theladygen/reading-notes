# Operators and Loops: Class 8

1.**What is an expression in JavaScript?**

At a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.

2.**Why would we use a loop in our code?**

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)

The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.

3.**When does a for loop stop executing?**

A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

4.**How many times will a while loop execute?**

A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.
