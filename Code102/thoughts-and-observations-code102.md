# Thoughts and Observations: Code 102

## Class 3

Holy smokes, revisions and the cloud has been wild. Fun, but wild. I think the biggest take away at this point is how messy things can get when I drag and drop folders and files willy nilly after I've cloned something! lol Still working out those kinks. However, I'm feeling **SO EXCITED** about this learning process. This is addictive!

Of note regarding CSS: What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?

All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:

1. Inline style (inside an HTML element)
2. External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
3. Browser default

So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults.

Also, if some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets, the value from the last read (most recently updated/last definted) style sheet will be used.
