1.**What is control flow?**

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

2.**What is a JavaScript function?**

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

3.**What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?**

The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
- Automatically (self invoked)

4.**What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?**

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas.
