# Thoughts and Observations

Class 3: revisions and the cloud has been wild. Fun, but wild. I think the biggest take away at this point is how messy things can get when I drag and drop folders and files willy nilly after I've cloned something! lol Still working out those kinks. However, I'm feeling **SO EXCITED** about this learning process. This is addictive!
