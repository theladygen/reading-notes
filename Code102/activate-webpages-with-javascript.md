1.**What are variables in JavaScript?**

Variables are containers for storing data/values (storing data values). A variable is a “named storage” for data.

2.**What does it mean to declare a variable?**

Declaring a variable is naming a container for storing data/values.

3.**What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?**

In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator. This is different from algebra. It assigns a value. For example:

x = x + 5

This assigns the value of x + 5 to x. (It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.)

Note: The "equal to" operator is written like == or === in JavaScript.

4.**What is information received from the user called?**
