# Growth Mindset

To me, a growth mindset means that we are always capable of growth and learning. There is never a time or place we reach where we know it all. Natural talent or abilities are lovely places to begin, but equal talents and skills can be developed through dedicated effort and perserverance.

## My Reminders for Maintaining a Growth Mindset

* Being uncomfortable is good! Normal even! And only temporary! Discomfort inevitably will lead to growth. Let it be a sign of good things to come.
* Imposter syndrome will strike, but shifting focus to the sheer inspiration that can be gleaned from the mentors and peers that surround you will help reignite that fire and determination to persist.
* Challenges will present again and again. Remember your team, your resources, your ability to search the **MAGIC** that is the internet and find exactly what you need is always at your fingertips. Perserverence, baby!
